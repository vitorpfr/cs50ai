Imagine a regression AI that makes the following predictions for the following 5 data points. What is the total L2 loss across all of these data points (i.e., the sum of all the individual L2 losses for each data point)? *
For data point 1, the true output is 2 and the AI predicted 4. For data point 2, the true output is 4 and the AI predicted 5. For data point 3, the true output is 4 and the AI predicted 3. For data point 4, the true output is 5 and the AI predicted 2. For data point 5, the true output is 6 and the AI predicted 5.

answer: 16

If Hypothesis 1 has a lower L1 loss and a lower L2 loss than Hypothesis 2 on a set of training data, why might Hypothesis 2 still be a preferable hypothesis? *
1 point
Hypothesis 1 might be the result of loss.
Hypothesis 1 might be the result of regularization.
Hypothesis 1 might be the result of regression.
Hypothesis 1 might be the result of overfitting.
Hypothesis 1 might be the result of cross-validation.

answer: Hypothesis 1 might be the result of overfitting.
