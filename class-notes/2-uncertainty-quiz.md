Consider a standard 52-card deck of cards with 13 card values (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 2-10) in each of the four suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades). If a card is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is a spade or a two? *

P(spade or two) = P(spade) + P(two) - P(spade and two)

P(spade or two) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 0.30769 ~ 0.308
answer: 0.308

Imagine flipping two fair coins, where each coin has a Heads side and a Tails side, with Heads coming up 50% of the time and Tails coming up 50% of the time. What is probability that after flipping those two coins, one of them lands heads and the other lands tails? *

P(1-heads and 2-tails) = P(1-heads) * P(2-tails | 1-heads)
= P(1-heads) * P(2-tails) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

other scenario: 1-tails and 2-heads = 0.25
answer: 0.5

Two factories — Factory A and Factory B — design batteries to be used in mobile phones. Factory A produces 60% of all batteries, and Factory B produces the other 40%. 2% of Factory A's batteries have defects, and 4% of Factory B's batteries have defects. What is the probability that a battery is both made by Factory A and defective? *

P(A ^ defective) = P(A) * P(defective | A) = 60% * 2% = 0.012
